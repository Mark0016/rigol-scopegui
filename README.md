# rigol-scopegui
A GUI application for controlling oscilloscopes over the network (tested on RIGOL MSO1000Z series)

It can display the signals being measured by the oscilloscope and change the most common settings.

Dependencies:

Python 3   (>=3.1)

PyQt4      (>=4.9)

pyqtgraph  (>=0.9.9)

vxi11      (included in files)

This is a GUI application I threw together as a school project.
The code is quite messy but i put it up for anyone to try it out.
It is capable of controlling oscilloscopes over the network using IPv4.
It was tested on a RIGOL MSO1074Z-S oscilloscope so it should work on the DS/MSO1000Z series.
I also briefly tested it on an MSO2072A and it worked fine (except channel 3 and 4 since it's a 2 channel scope) so it might work whit others as well.
I tested it on Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora tho it should work on any OS that supports it's dependencies.
